"	"As of 2005 , people in the United States stated that they have had an average of 10.7 sexual partners , which is slightly above the global average of nine sexual partners . Turkey in the lead ? Surveys on sensitive or very personal topics , like sexuality , are often to be taken with a grain of salt , but in this case , Turkey did not only lead the ranking in 2005 , it also topped the one conducted in 2010 on the mean number of sexual partners . So is it likely that the Turkish people are sexually more prolific than everybody else ? Another survey by another source suggests otherwise : It does not include Turkey when it comes to the countries with the most sexually active inhabitants but lists the Greek as the most active ones .
